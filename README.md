# CardioML_ParamEstimation:
## Cardiovascular Parameter Estimation with Regression Analysis
This repository contains scripts for performing regression analysis to estimate major cardiovascular parameters using non-invasive clinical data. The parameters include aortic Systolic Blood Pressure (aSBP), Cardiac Output (CO), and End-Systolic Elastance (Ees).

## Overview
Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, cardiovascular parameters) and one or more independent variables (clinical data). The goal is to develop a predictive model that can estimate these parameters based on the provided data.
